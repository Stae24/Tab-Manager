# Draft: Code Review for Appearance Settings Enhancements

## Requirements (confirmed)
- Review changes in `src/` related to the new resizable and scalable Appearance Settings Panel.
- Evaluate the implementation of global UI scaling in `Dashboard.tsx`.
- Check for bugs, performance issues, and adherence to project conventions.

## Technical Decisions (Observed)
- **Global Scaling**: Moved from font-size scaling to a `transform: scale()` wrapper in `Dashboard.tsx`.
- **Panel Resizing**: Implemented manual width dragging for the settings panel.
- **Panel Scaling**: Added a separate `settingsScale` for the panel content itself.
- **State Management**: Moved `showAppearancePanel` to the global Zustand store.
- **Debounced Updates**: `SliderControl` now supports `onChangeEnd` (mouse up/touch end) for persistent settings updates.

## Research Findings
- `Dashboard.tsx`: Scaling the entire container might affect absolute positioning of children (e.g., drag overlays).
- `AppearanceSettingsPanel.tsx`: 
    - Scaling the panel content while keeping the container width fixed might lead to layout issues if calculations are off.
    - `isResizing` state uses window listeners; needs to ensure cleanup (which is present).
- `index.css`: Introduction of CSS variables for scaled values.

## Open Questions
- How does the `transform: scale()` in `Dashboard.tsx` affect the `DndContext` and `DragOverlay` coordinate calculations?
- Does the `overflow-y: auto` on the scaled settings panel handle the extra height generated by `scale < 1` correctly?

## Scope Boundaries
- INCLUDE: All files modified in the current diff.
- EXCLUDE: Pre-existing logic not touched by the changes.
